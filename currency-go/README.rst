crypto currency transaction proxy mixnet microservice
=====================================================

Also known as currency-go because it's written in golang. This service
proxies transaction blobs to a *coin daemon via the BTC JSON HTTP
RPC. That is to say, many of crypto currency daemons use this RPC
besides just bitcoin. Here we only make use of the "Send Raw
Transaction" command. Yes, it's so simple. This service receives
transaction blobs from random sketch clients on the mixnet and it just
submits them to the blockchain. Done.
